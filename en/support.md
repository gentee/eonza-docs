We respect all our users and try to make their work more productive and pleasant.

**If**

* you have found a bug;
* you have suggestions for program improvement;
* you lack some features;
* you want to help developing Eonza;

**then**

* send an email to %html.email%;
* create a request at %html.issue%.

We respond to all incoming emails. If you have not received a reply, most likely it went to spam, or we have not received your email. In this case, it is better to use %html.issue%.

If you want to thank the developers or leave negative feedback, you can do this directly from the program. If you want to get a response, specify your email.
