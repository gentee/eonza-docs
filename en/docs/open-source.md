# Open Source

Eonza is an **open source** script creation and management software. The Eonza source code is hosted on **GitHub** and anyone can freely review, analyze and contribute to the Eonza codebase and related resources. We believe that the open source code is one of the most important features of Eonza. Open source gives you confidence in the future of the program and attracts developers and users with new ideas and suggestions. Also, [MIT license](license.html) allows anyone to build their own version of the program.

## Code and resource repositories
