# Packages

Package is a set of scripts designed to work with a specific external program or service. A package may also combine scripts that implement actions with the same objects. Each package can have several parameters, which are defined in the *Settings* dialog box. These parameters can be used in any script of the package. 

By default, only standard library scripts are available in the Eonza program. If you need scripts of a certain package, you just need to install it. In this case, you will see a folder with the package name and containing its scripts in the *Scripts* tab. Scripts of the package are protected from modification and deletion. If you stop using the features of a package, you can uninstall it. In this case, the package folder will be removed from the general list of scripts. The package's settings will be saved and restored if the package is installed again in the future.
