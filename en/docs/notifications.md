# Notifications

The Notifications tab contains a list of received notifications. Notifications can be created by the program itself or by [Notification](/scripts/notification.html) command. In the first case, these can be notifications about the availability of a new version or system messages about the program's performance. In the second case, a notification with any text can be sent from any script using the specified command. The program only shows last 25 notifications. All notifications are stored in a file with the *eon* extension. If you have accumulated a lot of notifications and do not want to delete them one by one, you can delete this file and restart the program.
