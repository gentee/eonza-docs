## License Information

%html.pro-general-license%

**License key**  
The entered license key is shown here, but the trailing characters are hidden for security reasons.

**Number of computers**  
The maximum number of computers on which you can install Eonza and use this license key. It should be noted that the license key is bound to the volume ID. Thus, you can install the program on a flash drive and run it on different computers.

**Expires on**  
The date the license expires. After that, the license key becomes invalid and the features of the Pro version are disabled. If you have previously enabled the trial mode and it has not ended, then the Pro version will continue to work.

**Status**  
License key status.

* *Invalid* - the key was generated by third parties.
